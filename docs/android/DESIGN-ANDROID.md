# DESIGN-ANDROID.md — the Android design charter

**Charter (2026-07-08): Android-first, Material 3 Expressive, no iOS constraints.**

The iOS app's `DESIGN.md` governs **what** the product does — screens, flows,
copy intent, feature semantics. It never governs how Android looks, moves, or
feels. Android is a first-class native app: if a choice would make the app feel
like a port, make the Android-native choice instead.

## 1. Foundations

### Color — monochrome inverted ink
- **Custom zero-chroma scheme** (`LightInkColorScheme` / `DarkInkColorScheme`
  in `ui/theme/Color.kt`, applied in `ui/theme/CashuTheme.kt`): white canvas +
  black ink in light mode, black canvas + white ink in dark mode — the brand
  identity shared with iOS ("inverted ink"). All neutrals are pure grays.
- **No Material You dynamic color** (locked decision, 2026-07-09): the palette
  must never shift with the wallpaper. Brand > Monet.
- Full M3 color roles are still used as designed: filled primary CTAs (black on
  light / white on dark), tonal secondaries, `secondaryContainer` nav
  indicator, tonal surface-container tiers (gray ramp). Components stay stock
  Material — only the palette is branded.
- **Semantic state hues stay fixed** (received green / pending orange / error
  red via `CashuColors` + the `error` role) — chromatic color is reserved
  exclusively for payment state.

### Type — Geist on the M3 scale
*Rewritten 2026-08-03.*

- **Geist Sans and Geist Mono, bundled** (`res/font/geist.ttf`,
  `geist_mono.ttf`; SIL OFL 1.1, surfaced in Settings → Licenses). Android-first
  carve-out, user-directed: iOS keeps SF Pro because SF Symbols are metrically
  bound to it and system-presented surfaces cannot be restyled. Neither cost
  applies here — Compose renders its own text and every M3 component reads
  `MaterialTheme.typography`, so the swap is total.
- **Source the GitHub release build, never Google Fonts.** The Google Fonts
  build strips the full OpenType table; if it were substituted,
  `withMonoDigits()` would silently no-op and every amount column would start
  jittering with no error anywhere. `GeistFontTest` parses the shipped files and
  fails the build if `tnum`, `ss09`, the `wght`-only axis set, or the declared
  cap/ascent ratios are wrong.
- **Sizes, line heights and tracking are Material's own.** Geist's cap height
  (0.710) and x-height (0.530) are within a thousandth of Roboto's, so
  Material's Roboto-tuned reading tracking transfers unchanged rather than
  needing a Geist-specific table. Measured, not assumed.
- **`ui/theme/Type.kt` owns everything.** `CashuTheme.type.*` supplies twelve
  app roles on top of the Material scale. `TextStyle.atSize(size, leading,
  trackingEm)` is the only sanctioned way to change a size — a bare
  `copy(fontSize = …)` orphans the line height, which is how the entry hero came
  to set 64sp type in a 52sp box, a 0.81× ratio that crops the glyph.
  `TypographyGuardTest` enforces this with an empty allowlist.
- **The amount ladder is four rungs**: `amountHero` 52sp (balance *and* live
  entry — one component, `ui/components/AmountHero.kt`), `amountConfirm` 40sp,
  `amountCompact` 28sp, `amountRow` 16sp. Typed by role, never by point size.
  52 rather than 56 because Geist sets ~7% wider than Roboto.
- **The unit is subordinated, not set at parity.** Formatters return
  `AmountParts`; `AmountHero` composes value and unit as two runs of one string
  (one `Text`, so autosize scales both together) with a unit word at half size,
  one weight down, secondary ink, baseline-aligned.
- Money always chains `withMonoDigits()`. The mono roles add `withSlashedZero()`
  — via **`ss09`**, since Geist ships no standard `zero` feature.
- **Weight carve-out (2026-07-10, user-directed):** tab titles render **Bold**
  via the shared `ui/components/TabTopBar.kt`, so every top-level tab's
  collapsing title is identical by construction. Native collapse-on-scroll is
  unchanged.

### Shape — stock M3
- `Shapes()` defaults (`ui/theme/Shape.kt`); `CapsuleShape` available.

### Motion — M3 Expressive springs
- `MaterialExpressiveTheme` + `MotionScheme.expressive()`: spring physics drive
  component motion. New motion should use `spring(...)` specs (or motion-scheme
  tokens), not hand-tuned tweens. Choreography constants that are literal iOS
  copies (70ms stagger step, 1100ms waiting-pulse, 900ms spinner period) live
  in `ui/theme/Motion.kt` (`CashuMotion`).
- **Shared motion primitives** (`ui/components/`): `SpinnerRing` (Canvas port
  of the iOS trimmed-arc payment spinner; reduce-motion falls back to
  `CircularProgressIndicator`), `IconSwap` (glyph replacement ≙ iOS
  `.symbolEffect(.replace)`), `rememberBounceScale` (one-shot bounce ≙
  `.symbolEffect(.bounce)`), `Modifier.materializeBlur()` (blur-to-sharp
  success materialize, API 31+ only), `AnimatedVisibilityScope.morphBlur()`
  (cross-fade mask — see below), `SkeletonValue` (redacted-style
  fill-in for pending quote values, no shimmer). Reuse these instead of
  re-deriving per screen.
- **Cross-fade masking** (`morphBlur`, `Materialize.kt`, added 2026-08-06): a
  small blur riding **both** halves of an `AnimatedContent` swap, so the eye
  reads one object transforming instead of two overlapping. `materializeBlur`
  cannot do this — it is a one-shot `LaunchedEffect` and so can only blur the
  incoming child — hence the sibling. Used on `PrimaryButton` / `GhostButton`
  labels (2 / 1.5 dp) and the onboarding chassis slot (3 dp). API 31+ and
  reduce-motion gated; below either, the plain cross-fade still carries the
  change. Rationale in `docs/product/DESIGN.md` §6.
- **Navigation**: shared-axis X (slide + fade) for push/pop; fade-through for
  tab switches (`CashuNavHost.kt`). Predictive back is enabled
  (`android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback`).
- **Sheet dismissal**: payment flows, activity receipts, and mint/unit/currency
  pickers use `CashuModalBottomSheet`. It retains the native Material sheet and
  gestures, but uses a spatial spring for dismissal while Material3 applies an
  effects spring to that translation. Sheet content keeps the normal motion
  scheme. `rememberSheetDismissAction` waits for a completed hide before a
  selection or navigation callback; repeated taps cannot dispatch twice and
  interruption cancels the pending action. Receipt backdrop blur clears when
  dismissal starts and returns if the sheet settles open again.
- **No hard cuts**: full-screen overlays (scanner, contactless) slide over the
  shell (`CashuApp.kt`); the bottom bar animates away on push
  (`WalletScaffold.kt`). The payment terminal's entrance splits by mount:
  processing/failure mounts fade + settle in as one unit
  (`PaymentStatusScreen.kt`'s root layer), while a terminal **mounted directly
  at success** (payment landed while a waiting face was up) plays the staged
  celebration — check materializes at ~100ms (bounce + blur + 0.92 grow, with
  the success haptic), title band at ~220ms (opacity + 8dp settle-rise), rows
  + Done at ~300ms (6dp rise on rows only — never blur, they're money; Done is
  tappable from frame 1). The success check carries the one celebration beat;
  failures stay deliberately still; reduce-motion collapses the stage to a
  flat fade. **Every** completion routes through the shared
  `PaymentStatusScreen` — including Receive Lightning (paid invoice) and a
  fresh Cashu Request's first payment, which swap the sheet body to the
  terminal with the standard `fadeIn(200)/fadeOut(150)` pair and keep an
  explicit Done (both platforms; an older note claimed a ~1.8s auto-dismiss
  carve-out that never shipped). A Cashu Request opened from *history* stays
  inline/persistent — it's reusable and multi-payment.
- **Touch responds physically**: CTAs and number-pad keys spring-scale on press
  (`Buttons.kt`, `NumberPad.kt`); text buttons dim to 0.6 while pressed
  (iOS `TextLinkButtonStyle`). The response is **asymmetric** — a spring carries
  no direction, so the spec is selected on the press edge instead:
  `fastEffectsSpec` compressing, `defaultEffectsSpec` releasing. *Effects*, not
  spatial, even for scale: Expressive's spatial springs are under-damped
  (0.6–0.8) and a press must not overshoot — it is a state flip, not a reflow,
  and no gesture momentum preceded it.
- Lists animate placement (`Modifier.animateItem()` — History, Home recent,
  Mint discovery), reveals expand/shrink, page dots stretch into pills.
- **Route swap (Transfer, 2026-09-30)**: the arrow between the From and To
  mints makes the two identities (avatar + name) travel to each other's slot on
  `defaultSpatialSpec`; the balance lines belong to the slots and change in
  place, and the arrow turns once and lands pointing down again. It is the one
  place two elements exchange positions, so the travel is what says which mint
  went where. A mint picked from the list has no old place to travel from and
  fades in. Reduced motion cross-fades the identities where they sit.
  Transfer rows use avatar rows instead of the pay screens' centered From/To
  line (`MintTransferRouteBlock.kt`; see `docs/product/DESIGN.md`).
- **Numbers are quiet**: `AmountText` cross-fades the whole string on change
  (`Spring.StiffnessMedium`, no per-digit slide) — the same restrained
  transition every other amount swap uses (`AmountFlipDisplay`, `BalanceDisplay`).
  The earlier per-digit odometer roll read as too much and was retired
  (2026-07-10). Home's received-delta beat still swaps into the fiat slot for
  2.5s with the sanctioned celebration spring (`BalanceDisplay`).
- **Reduce-motion**: decorative loops (waiting pulses, spinner ring, bounces,
  cascades) render their resting state when system animations are off.
  `rememberReducedMotion()` is reactive — it observes
  `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` and updates mid-session.
- **Onboarding exemption (2026-08-05, onboarding restyle, user-directed):**
  pre-wallet onboarding surfaces (`ui/onboarding/` — the chassis and stages,
  everything before `completeOnboarding()`/`completeRestore()`)
  carry their own motion spec, shared with iOS via the table in
  `docs/product/DESIGN.md` §6 and expressed here as motion-scheme springs
  (`motionScheme.defaultEffectsSpec/defaultSpatialSpec/fastEffectsSpec`), the
  gated `Modifier.materializeBlur()`, and `Modifier.riseIn` (70 ms
  `CashuMotion.StaggerStepMs` stride). **Nothing defined under this exemption
  may be reused inside the wallet proper.** Numbers stay quiet (the
  recovered-sats total keeps mono digits, no roll) and every onboarding
  animation is `rememberReducedMotion()`-gated to opacity-or-nothing. The
  exemption's terminal beat is the ASCII handoff (`OnboardingHandoff.kt`): a
  full-screen terrain curtain over the last onboarding screen that flips the
  app gate at full cover, then erodes: the scrim clears early so the wallet
  stands behind a terrain still substantially there, and the glyphs dissolve
  level by level (`AsciiFieldTerrain.erosionAlpha`, mirrored on iOS and pinned
  by `AsciiFieldErosionTest`) — faint plain first, ₿ peaks last. Nothing
  translates and no edge travels; the only motion is the field's own drift and
  the bloom's release swirl — onboarding-owned,
  hosted above the gate in `CashuApp` only so it survives the teardown it
  conceals, played once, never referenced by wallet code. The gate's own
  `transitionSpec` is untouched and plays unseen beneath it (plan 008 stays
  orthogonal); under Reduce Motion the curtain never mounts and the gate
  crossfade is the entire transition. The welcome ⇄ restoreMethod pair's
  screen-change cue is the ASCII backdrop's **vault morph**
  (`OnboardingAsciiBackdrop`, 2026-08-09, superseding that morning's extent
  settle): the full-window layer never moves; one 0…1 scalar on
  `motionScheme.defaultSpatialSpec` lerps every cell's brightness between
  welcome's tall terrain and restore's vault door (`AsciiFieldVault` — rings,
  spokes, ₿ bolts, ₿ monogram stencil; parity-pinned by
  `AsciiFieldVaultTest` against vectors from the design mock's Python) and
  shortens the mask's opaque ramp to end at the door's top edge; the clear
  line behind the header never moves, and the whole thing snaps under Reduce
  Motion — the iOS register is the step's own `.easeInOut(0.28)` transaction.
  Band mode survives in `AsciiFieldLayout` as math and tests only.
- **Onboarding system back (2026-08-05):** `OnboardingScreen` registers a
  `BackHandler` mirroring the on-screen back buttons exactly (seed reveal →
  welcome, method chooser → welcome, seed entry → welcome, mint staging →
  seed entry with the staged list cleared). Retreat-capable steps show an M3
  `ArrowBack` icon button (`OnboardingBackButton`) above their header; steps
  with no back affordance keep the platform default. Closes the gap where
  system back exited the app from every onboarding step.

### Components — expressive first
- Loaders are the expressive `LoadingIndicator` / `LinearWavyProgressIndicator`
  — never the classic circular/linear spinners. One carve-out: the payment
  terminal uses the custom `SpinnerRing` (cross-platform brand parity with the
  iOS pay-flow spinner).
- Tab screens use `LargeFlexibleTopAppBar` (big collapsing titles).
- Settings rows are M3 `ListItem`.
- Button hierarchy: filled `Button` (primary action) → `FilledTonalButton`
  (secondary) → `TextButton` (inline). See `PrimaryButton` / `SecondaryButton`
  / `GhostButton` / `DestructiveTextButton` in `Buttons.kt`.
- Button typography is owned by `Type.kt` and the shared components. Primary
  and secondary buttons use `buttonLabel` (18sp semibold); screen text actions
  use `textButtonLabel` (the same metrics, regular weight). Every `GhostButton`
  and `DestructiveTextButton` must specify `TextButtonContext.Screen` for
  standalone actions and alternatives below a CTA, or `.Compact` for field
  helpers, row actions, and dialogs (Material `labelLarge`). Screen code must
  not override button text styles. Destructive actions use the same component
  and sizing rules with error-colored text and an accessible warning.
- Bottom sheets (`ModalBottomSheet`) for choosers/pickers/inspectors; pushed
  destinations for flows. `NavigationBar` for tabs. Simple confirmations use
  `ActionConfirmationSheet`; destructive actions use a red primary button
  with white text.
- Text inputs go through `CashuTextField`. **One carve-out (2026-08-08):** the
  seed-entry card in `SeedWordEntry.kt` uses a bare `BasicTextField`, because
  `CashuTextField`'s job is to supply the container and here the *card is* the
  container — a second surface inside it would be a nested container.
- The seed-entry ghost cards use **alpha and scale, never `Modifier.blur`**.
  Skia renders blur one level differently across hosts, so a statically blurred
  element can never pass `validateDebugScreenshotTest` on Linux CI (the goldens
  are generated on macOS). Animated blur that settles to 0 is fine — previews
  are never captured mid-transition.
- **Accepted asymmetry:** iOS switches off inline predictions on the seed field
  so the keyboard's height stays constant for the whole step. Gboard's
  suggestion strip cannot be suppressed; `imePadding()` absorbs the difference
  instead.

### Layout invariants (kept from the structural pass)
- Measure, never assume, overlay heights (Home pinned header is pre-measured
  via `SubcomposeLayout`, so the first frame lays out with the correct list
  inset and fade mask — no hide-first-frame hacks).
- Consume the shell scaffold's window insets exactly once
  (`.consumeWindowInsets(contentPadding)` on every tab).
- Bottom inset spacers use `windowInsetsBottomHeight(WindowInsets.navigationBars)`.
- Dimension parameters are `Dp`, never raw `Int`.

### Haptics
`LocalHapticFeedback`: selection-class ticks on taps/toggles, `Confirm`/`Reject`
on payment terminal outcomes, `LongPress` where a long-press acts. Never
double-buzz one gesture.

## 2. Feature parity map (iOS = feature reference)

Screens and flows mirror iOS **functionally**: Home (balance, mint chip,
Receive/Send, recent activity), History (search/filter/pull-to-refresh),
Mints (+detail/discovery), Settings (+Backup, Lightning, Locked Ecash hub,
Nostr, Privacy), unified Send, Receive (ecash/lightning/requests), scanner,
contactless, onboarding. See git history for the parity passes.

## 3. Ranked gap backlog (features, not design)

1. **App Lock** — BiometricPrompt gate + `FLAG_SECURE` privacy scrim + Settings
   toggle. Also unlocks auth-gating for the nsec reveal sheets.
2. **Cloud seed backup** — Auto Backup / Blockstore / Drive decision pending.
3. **Cashu Request editing UI** — ✅ Mint / Amount / Unit inspector sub-sheets
   shipped; quote-backed receive artifacts remain correctly read-only.
4. **NFC tap-to-pay parity check** — verify `ContactlessPayView` against iOS
   coordinator flow and restyle to the new charter.
5. **Restore-over-units hardening** — loop restore across `mint.units` (do with
   iOS together).
6. **Home received-delta beat** — ✅ visual beat shipped (`BalanceDisplay`
   `receivedDelta`, driven by a balance-rise watch in `HomeScreen`). Still
   open: the success haptic for background receives, which needs a real
   receive-event signal from WalletManager to avoid double-buzzing in-flow
   receives.
7. **Non-sat History** — ✅ transaction loading now enumerates every tracked
   mint/unit wallet and preserves native-unit formatting in rows and details.
8. **Shared-element transitions** — transaction row → detail, QR card flows
   (`SharedTransitionLayout`), once nav-level motion has settled.
9. **Expressive `ButtonGroup` / shape-morph press states** — evaluate for the
   Receive/Send pair and number pad when the APIs stabilize.

## 4. Protected areas

- QR pipeline internals (`Views/Components/QRCodeView.kt`,
  `Core/AnimatedUrDecoder.kt`) are off-limits; style around them.
- The Nostr/P2PK seed is `sha256(mnemonic utf8)` on both platforms — never
  change unilaterally.
